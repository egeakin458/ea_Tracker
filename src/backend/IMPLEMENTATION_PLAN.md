## Security Requirements and Authorization

### Authentication Requirements
- All admin endpoints must use `[Authorize(Roles = "Admin")]`
- JWT tokens must include role claims for proper authorization
- Password verification must be timing-attack resistant
- Failed authentication attempts must be logged and rate-limited

### Authorization Matrix
| Endpoint Category | Required Role | Additional Checks |
|-------------------|---------------|-------------------|
| User Management | Admin | Owner verification for sensitive operations |
| System Configuration | Admin | IP whitelist verification |
| Audit Logs | Admin | Read-only access with filtering |
| Password Reset | Admin | Two-factor verification required |

### Security Policies
- Minimum password complexity: 8 chars, mixed case, numbers
- Account lockout: 5 failed attempts, 15-minute lockout
- JWT expiration: 15 minutes access, 7-day refresh
- Admin sessions: 8-hour maximum, require re-authentication for sensitive ops

## Risk Mitigation

### Static Error Prevention
- **Interface Contract Violations**
  Mitigation: Update all interfaces before implementations, use compile-time checking
  
- **Authorization Attribute Inconsistency**
  Mitigation: Create standardized authorization policy attributes, use code analysis rules

- **Dependency Injection Configuration**
  Mitigation: Add integration tests for DI container resolution, validate service registrations

### Runtime Error Handling
- **Password Hash Verification Failures**
  Mitigation: Implement fallback verification methods, add detailed diagnostic logging
  Recovery: Emergency password reset functionality, admin override capabilities

- **Database Connection Issues During Authentication**
  Mitigation: Implement connection retry logic, use cached authentication for temporary failures
  Recovery: Graceful degradation to read-only mode, admin notification system

- **JWT Token Validation Failures**
  Mitigation: Implement token refresh logic, graceful session extension
  Recovery: Force re-authentication with clear error messages, session recovery options

- **Admin Endpoint Unauthorized Access**
  Mitigation: Multiple authorization layers, request logging and alerting
  Recovery: Immediate session termination, security incident reporting

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests
- Password hash generation and verification with various inputs
- User service credential validation with edge cases
- Admin service operations with proper authorization checking
- JWT token generation and validation with role claims
- Error handling middleware with various exception types

### Integration Tests
- Complete authentication flow from login to JWT generation
- Admin endpoint authorization with different user roles
- Database seeding and user creation process
- Password reset and account recovery workflows
- Rate limiting and security middleware integration

### Edge Cases
- Concurrent password verification attempts
- Malformed JWT tokens and authorization headers
- SQL injection attempts in admin endpoints
- XSS attacks through user management forms
- Race conditions in account lockout mechanisms
- Memory exhaustion during bulk user operations

### Security Tests
- Penetration testing of admin endpoints
- Brute force attack simulation
- Token theft and replay attack scenarios
- Privilege escalation attempt detection
- Information disclosure through error messages

## Rollback Plan

### Emergency Rollback Procedures
1. **Database State Rollback**
   - Maintain backup of Users table before password hash fixes
   - Script to restore original password hashes if needed
   - Rollback migration for any schema changes

2. **Code Rollback Sequence**
   - Remove AdminController and admin endpoints
   - Revert authorization attribute changes
   - Remove AdminService from DI container
   - Restore original UserService implementation
   - Remove new middleware registrations

3. **Configuration Rollback**
   - Revert authentication middleware configuration
   - Restore original JWT settings
   - Remove new security policies and attributes

### Rollback Testing
- Automated rollback scripts with validation
- Verify system functionality after each rollback step
- Test authentication flow with original configuration
- Validate existing user accounts remain functional
